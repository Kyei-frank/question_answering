'What is a valid offer?',"The Court of Appeal erred when it held that Exhibit A and Exhibit B amounted to a contract. Before resolving the issue of interpretation raised in ground (a), however, it would be useful to remind ourselves, in outline, of the principles to be applied in distinguishing between offers and invitations to treat. Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated.",1.7070177,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['COUNSEL', 'BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI - PLAINTIFF/APPELLANT/RESPONDENT', 'VRS', 'N.T.H.C. - DEFENDANT/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU', 'DOE TSIKATA'], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'name': 'SUPREME COURT', 'location': {'country': 'GHANA', 'city': 'ACCRA – GHANA'}}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': '[2009] GHASC 5', 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C']}, 'presidingJudge': 'Akuffo, JSC', 'source': 'ghalii.org', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\5.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C', 'short': 'Antwi vs N.T.H.C'}}","It is important to emphasize the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations. I will hold and find that Ex ‘DD’ emanating from the plaintiff to the defendant will constitute a valid offer that was made to the defendant. Again applying the test as to acceptance, the offer of the plaintiff was not rejected by the defendant, neither was there a counter offer nor a demand or clarification for further information. Ex ‘EE’ was clear, in in its acceptance as it provided the purchase price per share, the amount of shares being accepted for the sale etc. If this cannot constitute acceptance of an offer, then what else can constitute acceptance.",1.6964048,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}","Marful-Sau JA had said in the court below, after quoting the text of the offer in the Fofie case, that:
 “Indeed comparing the above letter which was held to be a valid offer to Exhibit A in the instant appeal it will be untenable to hold that Exhibit A is not a valid offer. The above letter suggested that should the offeree indicate his acceptance, a further meeting was to be held, yet the Supreme Court affirmed the holding by both the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal that it was a valid offer.”
 In the Fofie case, what the plaintiff contended was an offer was in the following terms:
 “…I am prepared to offer the house to you for sale. The selling price is c75,000. If this is acceptable to you, please confirm to enable us hold a meeting with your solicitor on the matter. Hoping to hear from you soon.”
 The learned trial judge, Lutterodt J, as she then was, and the Court of Appeal construed this language to be a valid offer.",1.6584071,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
