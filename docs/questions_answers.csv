what is a case,"277-278) that:
 ""The present case is of a type which comes within the reason and spirit of the doctrine more fully perhaps than any other. The passenger sitting awake in a railroad car at the time of a collision, the pedestrian walking along the street and struck by a falling object or the debris of an explosion, are surely not more entitled to an explanation than the unconscious patient on the operating table. Viewed from this aspect, it is difficult to see how the doctrine can, with any justification, be so restricted in its statement as to become inapplicable to a patient who submits himself to the care and custody of doctors and nurses, is rendered unconscious, and receives some injury from instrumentalities used in his treatment. Without the aid of the doctrine a patient who received permanent injuries of a serious character, obviously the result of someone's negligence, would be entirely unable to recover unless the doctors and nurses in attendance voluntarily chose to disclose the identity of the negligent person and the facts establishing liability ... If this were the state of the law of negligence, the courts, to avoid gross injustice, would be forced to invoke the principles of absolute liability, irrespective of negligence, in actions by persons suffering injuries during the course of treatment under anaesthesia.",1.5351769,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': None, 'type': None}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['D.

The court must also consider the balance of convenience whilst maintaining the status quo. The evidence shows that the plaintiff Company is a company limited by guarantee and the law is settled that even though a company has a legal personality and exists independently of its members, it acts through individuals ie physical persons, usually through its members in general meetings or its board of directors or officers as set out in section 137(1) to (5) of the Companies Act 1963 (Act 179) which provide as follows:
 1)A company shall act through its members in general
 meeting or its board of directors or through officers or agents, appointed by or under authority derived from the members in general meetings or board of directors. 2)Subject to the provisions of this code, the respective powers of the members in general meeting and the board of directors shall be determined by the company’s Regulations
 3)Except as otherwise provided in the Company’s Regulations the business of the Company shall be managed by the board of directors who may exercise all such powers of the company as are not by this Code or the Regulations required to be exercised by the members in general meeting. 4)Notwithstanding the provisions of sub section (3) of this section the members in general meeting may
 a)Act in any matter if the members of the board of directors are disqualified or unable to act by reason of a deadlock on the board or otherwise
 b)Institute legal proceedings in the name and on behalf of the company if the board of directors refuse or neglect to do so

 The respondent answers the appellant’s point on the Fofie case as follows (in para.27 of its Statement of Case):
 “…As regards the argument that the Fofie case is distinguishable from the instant case because there had been previous discussions between the parties in that case, it is our submission that whether or not there had been previous discussions is quite irrelevant to the interpretation of Exhibit A and that what is important is that the language of that letter expresses and conveys an intention to contract.”
 We find this riposte by the respondent persuasive. Whilst recognising that the decision as to whether any particular set of language and context amounts to an offer or an invitation to treat depends on the detailed facts of specific cases, we also consider that the Fofie case provides a useful pointer regarding how to interpret the alleged offer in this case. In our view, the statement that: “The Board of Directors at the emergency Board meeting held on Friday, 31 December 2004 proposed to sell the Company’s houses being occupied by the Management Staff,” when read together with the two sentences that follow it that: “In this regard, you are being given the first offer to purchase the above-mentioned house at the cost price of US $70,307 or its Cedi equivalent. Payment shall be within 6 months.” and the totality of the context within which the transaction took place, can hardly be given any other interpretation than that it was an offer by the defendant/respondent/appellant company. The appellant’s argument that the use of the word “proposed” in the text quoted above robbed the alleged offer of “definitiveness” and therefore rendered it an invitation to treat is weak, because of the existence in that same text of the next two sentences.",1.5108551,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['COUNSEL', 'BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI - PLAINTIFF/APPELLANT/RESPONDENT', 'VRS', 'N.T.H.C. - DEFENDANT/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU', 'DOE TSIKATA'], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'name': 'SUPREME COURT', 'location': {'country': 'GHANA', 'city': 'ACCRA – GHANA'}}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': '[2009] GHASC 5', 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C']}, 'presidingJudge': 'Akuffo, JSC', 'source': 'ghalii.org', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\5.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C', 'short': 'Antwi vs N.T.H.C'}}"
