what is a case?,"277-278) that:
 ""The present case is of a type which comes within the reason and spirit of the doctrine more fully perhaps than any other. The passenger sitting awake in a railroad car at the time of a collision, the pedestrian walking along the street and struck by a falling object or the debris of an explosion, are surely not more entitled to an explanation than the unconscious patient on the operating table. Viewed from this aspect, it is difficult to see how the doctrine can, with any justification, be so restricted in its statement as to become inapplicable to a patient who submits himself to the care and custody of doctors and nurses, is rendered unconscious, and receives some injury from instrumentalities used in his treatment. Without the aid of the doctrine a patient who received permanent injuries of a serious character, obviously the result of someone's negligence, would be entirely unable to recover unless the doctors and nurses in attendance voluntarily chose to disclose the identity of the negligent person and the facts establishing liability ... If this were the state of the law of negligence, the courts, to avoid gross injustice, would be forced to invoke the principles of absolute liability, irrespective of negligence, in actions by persons suffering injuries during the course of treatment under anaesthesia.",1.5400453,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': None, 'type': None}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['D.

There was evidence by the plaintiff that she was hospitalised for roughly three months and that after the amputation, she felt pains at the stump of the right arm. She was no longer able to pursue her trade as a seamstress nor to perform her housewifely duties and to attend to her two infant children. She had to engage the services of a maidservant since her discharge from hospital at the cost of �3.00 a month. In the course of the trial, her customary husband divorced her because of her deformity even though she was still beautiful and charming. She specifically claimed �330.00 being loss of earnings at the rate of �30.00 a month for eleven months. She did not claim the monthly earnings of �30.00 up to the date of trial nor the �3.00 a month which she had to pay to the maidservant.

 The respondent answers the appellant’s point on the Fofie case as follows (in para.27 of its Statement of Case):
 “…As regards the argument that the Fofie case is distinguishable from the instant case because there had been previous discussions between the parties in that case, it is our submission that whether or not there had been previous discussions is quite irrelevant to the interpretation of Exhibit A and that what is important is that the language of that letter expresses and conveys an intention to contract.”
 We find this riposte by the respondent persuasive. Whilst recognising that the decision as to whether any particular set of language and context amounts to an offer or an invitation to treat depends on the detailed facts of specific cases, we also consider that the Fofie case provides a useful pointer regarding how to interpret the alleged offer in this case. In our view, the statement that: “The Board of Directors at the emergency Board meeting held on Friday, 31 December 2004 proposed to sell the Company’s houses being occupied by the Management Staff,” when read together with the two sentences that follow it that: “In this regard, you are being given the first offer to purchase the above-mentioned house at the cost price of US $70,307 or its Cedi equivalent. Payment shall be within 6 months.” and the totality of the context within which the transaction took place, can hardly be given any other interpretation than that it was an offer by the defendant/respondent/appellant company. The appellant’s argument that the use of the word “proposed” in the text quoted above robbed the alleged offer of “definitiveness” and therefore rendered it an invitation to treat is weak, because of the existence in that same text of the next two sentences.",1.5036585,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['COUNSEL', 'BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI - PLAINTIFF/APPELLANT/RESPONDENT', 'VRS', 'N.T.H.C. - DEFENDANT/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU', 'DOE TSIKATA'], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'name': 'SUPREME COURT', 'location': {'country': 'GHANA', 'city': 'ACCRA – GHANA'}}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': '[2009] GHASC 5', 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C']}, 'presidingJudge': 'Akuffo, JSC', 'source': 'ghalii.org', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\5.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C', 'short': 'Antwi vs N.T.H.C'}}","The disagreement in that case between the Court of Appeal and the trial judge was as to whether there had been any acceptance of this offer. The appellant in the present case in its Statement of Case argues that the distinction between what was construed to be an offer in the Fofie case and the alleged offer in this case lies in the fact that the parties in the Fofie case had had an earlier discussion and the quotation set out above was from a confirmatory letter. The appellant’s argument is set out as follows in its Statement of Case (para. 14):
 “The said Exhibit B was thus written in furtherance of the earlier discussions between the parties and was only to formalize the earlier discussion. It is on this basis that all the Courts from the High Court through to the Supreme Court, took the position that Exhibit B, the confirmation letter, was an offer.",1.4732656,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}","The defendant is now an old woman and is deteriorating in health. There is no question that she could re-marry and it appears she has no intention of taking a formal divorce from her husband's family.

The defendants became by law duty bound to ensure the safe custody of her and to deliver her back to the plaintiff whether dead or alive. These duties are imposed on the defendants by their accepting the child into their custody for treatment. A breach therefore of any of these duties would justify an action by the parents of the child, against the defendants provided that they can prove negligence and subsequent loss arising out of it.
