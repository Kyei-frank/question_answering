 I think I have canvassed this matter at length to show that the mere words ""res ipsa loquitur"" ought not to be pleaded in any way, certainly not in the manner in which it appears here and in Bullen and Leake and Benas and Essenhigh. In this case before me the plaintiff gave evidence and called three witnesses. The first witness was her husband, the second her husband's father and the third was the doctor who referred her to the Okomfo Anokye Hospital. Her evidence is that she is a seamstress and that some time in 1967 when she was nineteen years old she became pregnant and \[p.330\] in the second month of her pregnancy she developed pains in her stomach.

legal opinion on force majeure,"\[35\] Her behavior to my mind raises a supplemental question which is whether or not this Court should endorse such an approach where a citizen of this Republic is allowed to take the law into his or her hands to prevent another from performing his lawful official duty when there is no legal injunction or impediment under the guise of protecting “his space”; and if an injury occurs as in this case the same belligerent person then comes to the Court to seek damages. To my mind the Court should not endorse such a behavior because that would potentially render our society to the dynamics of a Hobbesian state of anarchy and chaos. \[36\] Finally, I am grateful to both Counsel for their assistance.
