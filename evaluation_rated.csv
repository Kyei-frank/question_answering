What case defines what an offer is?,"The Court of Appeal erred when it held that Exhibit A and Exhibit B amounted to a contract. Before resolving the issue of interpretation raised in ground (a), however, it would be useful to remind ourselves, in outline, of the principles to be applied in distinguishing between offers and invitations to treat. Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated.",yes,"It is important to emphasize the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations. I will hold and find that Ex ‘DD’ emanating from the plaintiff to the defendant will constitute a valid offer that was made to the defendant. Again applying the test as to acceptance, the offer of the plaintiff was not rejected by the defendant, neither was there a counter offer nor a demand or clarification for further information. Ex ‘EE’ was clear, in in its acceptance as it provided the purchase price per share, the amount of shares being accepted for the sale etc. If this cannot constitute acceptance of an offer, then what else can constitute acceptance.",y,"Thus the indefinite communication may be what generates an offer from the other side. An invitation to treat is thus to be distinguished from an offer on the basis of the proposal’s lack of an essential characteristic of an offer, namely, its finality which gives a capacity to the offeree to transform the offer into a contract by the mere communication of his or her assent to its terms. Thus Chitty on Contracts (28th Edition, 1999) Vol. 1 para. 2-007 at p.",y

 “Indeed comparing the above letter which was held to be a valid offer to Exhibit A in the instant appeal it will be untenable to hold that Exhibit A is not a valid offer. The above letter suggested that should the offeree indicate his acceptance, a further meeting was to be held, yet the Supreme Court affirmed the holding by both the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal that it was a valid offer.”
 In the Fofie case, what the plaintiff contended was an offer was in the following terms:
 “…I am prepared to offer the house to you for sale. The selling price is c75,000. If this is acceptable to you, please confirm to enable us hold a meeting with your solicitor on the matter. Hoping to hear from you soon.”
 The learned trial judge, Lutterodt J, as she then was, and the Court of Appeal construed this language to be a valid offer.",y
What are the principles of an injunction,"See Owusu v Owusu-Ansah and Anor. \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 870 Holding 1 as follows:-
 “(1) the granting or refusal of an injunction is at the discretion of the trial court but that discretion ought to be exercised judiciously …. The fundamental principle in applications for interim injunction is whether the applicant has a legal right at law or in equity, which the court ought to protect by maintaining the status quo until the final determination of the action on its merits. This could only be determined by considering the pleadings and affidavit evidence before the court”. It was also held in Odonkor and Others v Amartei \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 578 Holding 1 as follows:-
 “(1) the basic purpose of interim orders, was as much as possible to hold the balance evenly between the parties, pending a final resolution of matters in difference between them and also to ensure that at the end of the day the successful party did not find that his victory was one or one that brought him more problems than blessings”.",y,"Amartei \[1987-1988\] 1 GLR 578 S.C. \-Frimpong vs. Nana Asare Obeng ll \[1974\] 1 GLR 16
 The guiding principle for the grant of interlocutory injunction as enacted in Order 25 rule 1 (1) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004, C.I. 47 is that the Court may grant an injunction in all cases in which it appears to the Court to be just or convenient to do so. Although discretionary, there are settled principles for the grant of injunctions.",y,"In Owusu v Owusu-Ansah \[2007-2008\] 2 SCGLR 870, this Court held that:
 “The fundamental principle in applications for interim injunction is whether the applicant has a legal right at law or in equity, which the court ought to protect by maintaining the status quo until the final determination of the action on its merits. This could only be determined by considering the pleadings and affidavit evidence before the court.""

 From the litany of judicial decisions, it has also long been settled that in considering an application for injunction, a court ought to consider inter alia the following factors:
 These principles were reiterated by this Court in the case of 18th July vs.",y
What underpins res ipsa loquitor principle,"(2) Res ipsa loquitur
 In examining the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in relation to this case one must needs be reminded of Lord Upjohn's statement in Colvilles v. Devine \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 53, H.L. that the true ambit of the doctrine still requires further elucidation by the House of Lords. In Halsbury's Laws of England (3rd ed.), Vol.",y,"238, H.L., they gave fair notice of the case which has to be met so that the opposing party may direct his evidence to the issue disclosed by them'.""
 The idea that res ipsa loquitur as such is pleadable must have probably arisen ex abundanti cautela because of the caution of pleaders. In Benas and Essenhigh's Precedents of Pleadings (2nd ed.), one of the specimen statements of claim in negligence contains this at p. 236, ""In regard to each of the Defendants the Plaintiff will rely on the principle of res ipsa loquitur-. And at p. 536 of Bullen and Leake referred to by Amissah J.A.",y,"If by any reason of omission or default he is not able to do so at the very beginning of the case, he would be well advised to take advantage of the earliest opportunity to amend his pleadings so as to indicate clearly that res ipsa loquitur is in issue.""
 I think I have canvassed this matter at length to show that the mere words ""res ipsa loquitur"" ought not to be pleaded in any way, certainly not in the manner in which it appears here and in Bullen and Leake and Benas and Essenhigh. In this case before me the plaintiff gave evidence and called three witnesses. The first witness was her husband, the second her husband's father and the third was the doctor who referred her to the Okomfo Anokye Hospital. Her evidence is that she is a seamstress and that some time in 1967 when she was nineteen years old she became pregnant and \[p.330\] in the second month of her pregnancy she developed pains in her stomach. Although she was conscious she could not speak and her husband took her to a private hospital at Suame junction.",y
Can the liability of a subsidiary company be extended to a parent company,"439, C.A. where after the business had been converted into a private company the agreement provided that the company should fulfil existing contracts as agents of the seller. Where there is no such agreement it is a question of fact in each case whether the subsidiary company is carrying on the parent company's business or its own. In this regard I think all the circumstances must be taken into account the following being particularly relevant:
 (1) Are the profits treated as those of the parent company? (2) Are the persons conducting the business appointed by the parent company?",y,"In this capacity, a company is a corporate being, which, within the bounds of the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179) and its regulations may perform all the duties of a natural person. In its own name, it can sue and be sued and it can owe and be owed legal liabilities. A company once duly incorporated is thus a separate legal personality with a capacity separate, independent and distinct from its members and persons employed by it. This is the cardinal principle of Company Law enunciated in the celebrated case of Salomon v Salomon & Company Limited \[1897\] AC 22. In the recent case of Soonboon Seo v Gateway Worship Centre \[2009\] SCGLR 278 Holding 4, the Supreme Court held succinctly that:
 “It is clear from the record of appeal that, the second-plaintiff church is a company limited by guarantee and incorporated under the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179).",y,"where the directors make a profit as the result of their fiduciary position, they have to account to the company for it.�
 Clearly neither on the facts nor on the law had the defendant a title of a right to the company's assets. He had no defence at law to the claim for the return of the company's assets. In the circumstances for any court to rely on any technical reason to order what may amount to a retention in the defendant's hands of the company's property even for the briefest of moments would be perpetuating an inexcusable illegality. On 17 March 1986, long after the vacation of the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was), the plaintiffs applied again to the High Court, presided over by Lutterodt J., for the offending paragraphs in the defence to be struck out and judgment entered for the plaintiffs.",y
can you repeat an injunction application in the same court,What this court did when it granted the order of interim injunction was hearing the appeal without having the record of appeal. ,y,"The plaintiff/appellant on the same day 24th May 2018 filed an application for an order of interlocutory injunction praying the Court for the following interim orders:
 a)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th defendants/respondents from holding themselves out as subscribing members and executive council members of the applicant company
 b)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 1st respondent from holding himself out as company secretary of the applicant company
 c)An order for interlocutory injunction compelling the 8th and 9th respondents to allow the applicant company to have access to its accounts;
 d)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 10th respondent from interfering with or altering the records of the plaintiff company without the knowledge consent and authorization of the foundational members and directors as the case may require per the regulations of the Companies Act. The 1st to 7th defendants also filed an application for interlocutory injunction on 13th July 2018 and subsequently on 17th July 2018 filed their statement of defence and counterclaim. In their application for interlocutory injunction, the 1st to 7th defendnats prayed the Court for an order of interlocutory injunction to restrain the plaintiff and any other persons acting on its behalf, their assigns, agents, and privies from operating any bank account of the plaintiff company held at the 8th and 9th defendant banks until the final determination of the action and for such further and other orders as to this honourable court may deem it fit. In their statement of defence the 1st to 7th defendants denied the plaintiff’s claim and counterclaimed as follows against the plaintiff:
 i)A declaration that the 2nd to 5th defendants to the counterclaim are not directors, officers or employees of the 1st defendant to the counterclaim. ii) An order of perpetual injunction restraining the 2nd to 5th
 defendants to the counterclaim from carrying themselves out as directors, officers or employees of the 1st defendant to the counterclaim.",y,"The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from implementing the notice on the grounds that in the exceptional circumstances of the relationship between the parties and the plaintiff's likely protection by the coming into operation of Part II of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971 before a fresh notice could take effect, his contract of employment was still subsisting and damages not being at all adequate remedy, he was entitled to the interim injunction. Again in Jones v Lee (1911) 106 LT 123 it was held on appeal that the plaintiff had a right to be heard and represented before any decision relating to his dismissal was taken by the defendants who had acted wrongly in purporting to dismiss him and that interlocutory injunction should be granted. Each case, ultimately, must be decided on its own merit. In the situation where the defendants were hit by a force majeure and were under a constraint to embark on a redundancy exercise the plaintiffs could not have sued either for an injunction to restrain the defendant from dismissing them or for specific performance. The remedy for their ""illegal"" dismissal truly lay in damages.",y
battery and assault principles,"85, ""assault"" covered assault with battery and assault without battery. On his own showing the appellant was guilty of assault without battery and his conduct in rushing at the complainant with apparent intention to cause her harm and intending to put her in fear of danger, fell squarely within the illustration of assault in Act 29, s. 87 (b). CASES REFERRED TO
 (1) R. v.",y,"But counsel for the Republic has made a subsidiary point worthy of consideration. She submitted that the charge was one of assault and that by definition under section 85 of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29), the expression ""assault"" covers not only assault and battery but assault without battery as well; that all the appellant is complaining of is that there was no battery in the form of the slap whereas the magistrate had held that there was; and that on the appellant's own showing he was guilty of assault albeit without battery. In support of this submission learned counsel referred to section 87(1) of the Code which provides that:
 \[p.616\]
 ""A person makes an assault without actual battery on another person, if by any act apparently done in commencement of an assault and battery, he intentionally puts the other person in fear of an instant assault and battery.""
 This definition is made subject to the provision that ""It is not necessary that an actual assault and battery should be intended . . .",y,"In the case of Cole vrs. Turner {1706} 6 Mod. 149, Holt C.J. stated that the least “touching of another in anger is a battery;” and this is still the law. In the law of battery there is no requirement to prove that the contact caused or threatened to cause any physical injury or harm.",y
the effect of failure to correct an error apparent on the face of the record of appeal,"Where there are evidence that the facts were not properly discussed and if they are properly discussed and evaluated the errors to be corrected, may overturn the judgment, the appeal should succeed. On the other hand, where the errors are corrected and would not disturb the judgment, the appeal should fail. Where a court is setting aside a judgment, on the premise that the judgment is against the evidence on record, the court must satisfy itself that the mistakes to be corrected arising from the improper evaluation of the facts should be a genuine one and not fanciful errors. In the case in point the Appellant’s concern is that the trial Judge held that an employer who terminates the employee’s employment is not required to assign reason but where he assigns reasons he should be able to justify it. The Defendant disagrees with the above statement made by the trial court which influenced its decision and the correct position of the law should be restated.",y,"It is important to point out that the establishment of a blunder or error per se is not enough. It must further be established that the said error has led to a miscarriage of justice. We do not think the appellant herein discharged the burden on him or passed the test in the case cited so as to warrant the findings of fact and the principles of law applied by the lower courts, to be interfered with or set aside in this appeal. We rather affirm all of them and dismiss all grounds of appeal, original and or additional. For all the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed and the appeal dismissed.",y,"The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal against the judgment on several grounds. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the trial court and granted perpetual injunction to restrain the defendant from disposing of Ogbojo lands without the approval of the plaintiff. The defendant/respondent appealed against the whole judgment of the Court of Appeal, on the original ground that:
 �(i) the judgment is against the weight of the evidence on the record�. No other ground(s) has or have been added upon the receipt of the record so that remains the only ground of appeal before us. However, the sold ground of appeal was broken into sub-heads, namely that:
 �(a) The Court of Appeal�s acceptance of the Respondent�s historical account on Ogbojo land is against the account of the Appellants when the onus of proof rest on the Respondent is unsupportable by the evidence.",y
legal opinion on force majeure,"\[35\] Her behavior to my mind raises a supplemental question which is whether or not this Court should endorse such an approach where a citizen of this Republic is allowed to take the law into his or her hands to prevent another from performing his lawful official duty when there is no legal injunction or impediment under the guise of protecting “his space”; and if an injury occurs as in this case the same belligerent person then comes to the Court to seek damages. To my mind the Court should not endorse such a behavior because that would potentially render our society to the dynamics of a Hobbesian state of anarchy and chaos. \[36\] Finally, I am grateful to both Counsel for their assistance. They represented their clients with candour and respect for each other and I was impressed. On Cost I am inclined to say the parties should bear their cost because of the circumstances of this case.",y,"As my noble and learned friend Lord Mustill and I have good reason to know (see J Bracconot et Cie v Cie des Messageries Maritimes (The Sindh) \[1975\] 1 Lloyd's Rep 372), France has adopted the former solution in its doctrine of non cumul, under which the concurrence of claims in contract and tort is outlawed (see Weir in XI Int Enc Comp Law, ch 12, paras 47-72, at para 52).
